# 🌐 Introduction to Terraform

## 1. What is Terraform? 🏗️

- Terraform is a **popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool**.
- Developed by **HashiCorp**, it is **free and open-source**.
- Installs as a **single binary**, making setup fast.
- Allows building, managing, and destroying infrastructure in **minutes**.
- Can deploy infrastructure across **multiple platforms**:
  - Private cloud (e.g., on-premise vSphere)
  - Public cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - Network infrastructure, databases, monitoring tools, and version control systems.

---

## 2. Providers in Terraform ⚙️

- Terraform manages different platforms through **providers**.
- Providers enable Terraform to interact with platforms via **APIs**.
- Examples of supported platforms:
  - **Cloud Providers:** AWS, GCP, Azure
  - **Network & Security:** BigIP, CloudFlare, Palo Alto Networks, Infoblox
  - **Monitoring & Data:** DataDog, Grafana, Wavefront, Sumo Logic
  - **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, InfluxDB
  - **Version Control:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- Terraform supports **hundreds of providers**, making it highly versatile.

---

## 3. HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) 📝

- Terraform uses **HCL** (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to define infrastructure.
- HCL is **declarative**, simple, and human-readable.
- Infrastructure resources are defined in files with **`.tf` extension**.
- Code can be **version-controlled** and shared across teams.
- Example: Provisioning an **EC2 instance** on AWS.

---

## 4. Declarative Approach in Terraform 🔄

- Declarative means defining the **desired state** of infrastructure.
- Terraform determines the **steps to move from current state to desired state** automatically.
- Users don’t need to manually define how to reach the desired state.

---

## 5. Terraform Workflow Phases ⏳

1. **Init**:
   - Initializes the project
   - Identifies required providers
2. **Plan**:
   - Drafts a plan to reach the desired state
3. **Apply**:
   - Executes changes to bring the infrastructure to the desired state

- Subsequent `apply` runs **fix only missing components** if the state drifts.

---

## 6. Resources in Terraform 🖥️

- Every managed object is called a **resource**.
- Examples:
  - Compute instances (VMs)
  - Database servers
  - On-premise servers
- Terraform manages the **entire lifecycle**:
  - Provisioning
  - Configuration
  - Decommissioning

---

## 7. Terraform State 📂

- Terraform records the **current state of infrastructure**.
- Determines necessary actions for updates.
- Ensures infrastructure always matches the **defined desired state**.
- State can also be used to **read attributes of existing resources** via data sources.
- Terraform can **import existing resources** into management.

---

## 8. Terraform Cloud & Enterprise ☁️

- Provide enterprise features:
  - Team collaboration
  - Centralized UI
  - Improved security
- Simplify large-scale infrastructure management.
- Make Terraform suitable for **enterprise-grade provisioning**.

---

## 9. Exam Questions & Answers ✅

1. **Q:** What is Terraform and who developed it?  
   **A:** Terraform is an IaC tool for provisioning infrastructure, developed by HashiCorp.

2. **Q:** Name three types of platforms Terraform can manage.  
   **A:** Public cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure), on-premise servers, network infrastructure.

3. **Q:** What language does Terraform use to define infrastructure?  
   **A:** HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

4. **Q:** What are the three main phases in Terraform workflow?  
   **A:** Init, Plan, Apply.

5. **Q:** How does Terraform handle state drift?  
   **A:** It detects drift and `apply` fixes only the missing or changed components.

# 🌐 How Terraform Interacts with AWS

Terraform automates AWS resource management by interacting **directly with AWS APIs**, instead of using the console manually.

---

## 1. Key Concepts 🔑

- Terraform communicates with AWS using **API requests**.
- Your Terraform configuration (`.tf` files) defines the **desired state** of your infrastructure.
- When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform **creates, updates, or deletes resources** to match the desired state.
- Terraform maintains a **state file** to track:
  - What exists in the cloud
  - What changes are needed
